    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pav Bhaji is Mumbai's most iconic street food—comforting, spicy, and absolutely delicious. The "bhaji" is a thick vegetable mash made by cooking potatoes, peas, carrots, cauliflower, and bell peppers with tomatoes, onions, butter, and pav bhaji masala. It's mashed and simmered until the flavors meld into a buttery, spicy explosion. Served with lightly toasted pav (soft bread rolls) slathered in butter, and garnished with chopped onions and a squeeze of lemon, Pav Bhaji is a feast for the senses.</p>
    <p>Originally created as a quick meal for textile workers in Mumbai, Pav Bhaji has evolved into a must-have snack across India. It's perfect for casual dinners, family gatherings, or even party appetizers. Its spicy aroma, vibrant colors, and satisfying texture make it both crowd-pleasing and comforting. Whether eaten on the street or at home, Pav Bhaji is a flavor-packed dish that never goes out of style.</p>
