    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chole Bhature is a beloved North Indian dish known for its bold flavors and indulgent texture. The "Chole" is a spicy chickpea curry simmered in a rich blend of onions, tomatoes, and aromatic spices like cumin, turmeric, and chole masala. Each spoonful bursts with deep, earthy flavors that pair perfectly with the soft, pillowy Bhature—deep-fried fermented flatbreads made from all-purpose flour and yogurt. Often garnished with coriander and served with onions and lemon, this dish is hearty, satisfying, and full of character.</p>
    <p>Traditionally enjoyed as a breakfast or brunch item in Punjab and Delhi, Chole Bhature has become a street food icon across India. Its contrasting textures—the soft chickpeas soaked in thick gravy and the crisp, puffy bhature—make it a festive comfort food. Whether you're serving it at a get-together or enjoying it on a relaxed weekend, Chole Bhature never fails to hit the spot. It’s more than a meal—it’s an experience of North Indian culinary richness.</p>
